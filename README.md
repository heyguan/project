This repository contains codes and relevant dataset of my project. And the relevant dataset can be download here: 

[classification dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hKFVR-9g29ocYR5VdkLwk7mCvm1v2jwm/view?usp=sharing) and [segmentation dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ag8vjY6O4AIwYICvUlI7Tfve2qkR_7J/view?usp=sharing). Pre-trained model for experiment B is abvailabel at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NwWAKoeXuCjd2GC7pT-rcSdPWFlCBnG8/view?usp=sharing).

Please note: classification dataset has been reorientated to axial and compressed compared to original dataset. 

They are all ipynb files and run on Google Colab. To rerun these codes, I recommand use Colab to get better experience.

The required python packages has been mentioned in each ipynb file and I wrote the codes for installing them

Expriment A are all written in Pytorch, while experiment B are all written in Keras. Pytorch and Keras has been pre-installed in Colab.
